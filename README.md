# Discontinued
Due to [XDefiant being released on May 21 2024](https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2024/05/02/xdefiant-release-date-revealed-and-its-almost-here/), Project Utopia is no longer being developed. However I will just keep this project archived to leave something I've made.

See you in the [Crossverse Eight](https://github.com/RoonMoonlight/Crossverse-Eight), mercenaries!
